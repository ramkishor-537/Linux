Domain
DNS -> Domain name system

Example:
Contact will saved as a Name in smart phone -> Name will have Mobile number
computers will understand -> numbers

DNS-> translate domain name to ipaddress
example:
When we type websitename it translates to ipaddress

ICANN -> Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
It is an Non profit organisation
ensures the security, stability, and interoperability of the global Internet by managing the Domain Name System (DNS) and coordinating unique identifiers like IP addresses.


DNS resolver -> responsible to get IP address for the domains

Root servers -> there are 13 root servers in the world formed by different organisations
root servers responsibility is DNS resolution

Domain information and TLD information

TLD -> top level domains

.com
.us
.in
.uk
.net
.org
.edu
.co
.ai
.shop
.online


What happens if we buy the domain?
GoDaddy, hostinger, aws, gcp, azure, etc...

domainname.com
1. availability check -> check with TLD owner is that domain available or not?
2. if available, collect the details name, company, address, mobile, email id, payment info, etc.
3. when we complete payment, GoDaddy updates TLD about buyer details and domain details..

create one A record against the domain
domainname.com A ipaddress
update anything in your domain it propagates to TLD..

Root servers
=============
tracks all the TLD and their addresses..

Root servers has TLD information...

Browser -> Cache -> OS -> Cache -> ISP DNS Resolver -> Cache -> Root servers -> TLD information -> Contact TLD -> godaddy -> it will now fetch A record for us

NS -> Name servers
Who is managing the domain, who is responsible to provide IP address..

TTL means Time to Live

DNS Records
===============
TTL -> Time to Live -> How much time to live in cache or How much time to update
A record -> Holds the IP address of your domain

TTL: 1hr: 3600Seconds

why TTL ?
when an IP address of a old server was changed to new server then mention the TTL to update in the whole process: Browser -> Cache -> OS -> Cache -> ISP DNS Resolver -> Cache -> Root servers -> TLD information -> Contact TLD -> godaddy -> it will now fetch A record for us
During the migration of old server to new server the TTL time should 1 sec after all cache was updated in the whole process then change TTL to 1hr

without reducing the TTL from 1hr to 1 sec we can face all issues in 1 day?
this is the use case or root cause analysis to above problem
solution:
when we are updating or doing major updating the application in servers : atleast 1 day before reduce TTL to 1sec otherwise website will not work properly or server will be down because ISP DNS Resolver -> Cache will point to old IP address or old record will be updated of the server remaining the process will break

Process: Browser -> Cache -> OS -> Cache -> ISP DNS Resolver -> Cache -> Root servers -> TLD information -> Contact TLD -> godaddy -> it will now fetch A record for us

once major updating application is fine in servers, once the new ip address got updated in the whole above process then take TTL back to 3600seconds or 1 hour

why we have to change TTL from 1 sec to 1 hour after new server is stable or migrated from old server to new server?
To avoid these issues:
	a. Slower Website for Users
	b. Zero Protection Against DNS Outages
	c. Massive Increase in DNS Costs
	d. Overloading Your Own Infrastructure: 
		unnecessary CPU and memory load on your authoritative nameservers, which could lead to performance bottlenecks during high traffic spikes because When same data is requested by multiple users each time the request goes to server instead from cache there

Root servers:
	13 root servers across the world managed by different organisations and governments to control TLD's and part of ICANN. DNS resolutions requests from ISP comes to root servers

ToplevelDomain: TLD
	Top level domains, basically who sells the domains. It has the complete details of the domains booked, available, buyer information, etc.

Registars:
	Who sells the domains, basically mediators between TLD and end users. Who can manage the domain too
	
NameServer:NS
	Who is currently managing the domain, we can buy domain with one registar and we can transfer the management to another registar by updating NS records.
	
A record is mapping the IP address to domain

A domain cannot have multiple IP Address?
Solution: subdomains
subdomains: domainname.online

nslookup domainname.online # resolve domain to ip

systemctl status servicename # check the particular service is running or not
netstat -lntp # it displays all tcp ports present listening for connections on a system
ps -ef | grep node # select all process, display full details and filter only node
curl http://localhost:8080/health # health check of an url
telnet IP port # check the destination server is up


HTTP status codes
===================

100 -> informational
Continuing or switching protocols from HTTPS to HTTP

2XX -> Success
	200 -> OK
	201 -> Created
	204 -> Deleted
	
3XX -> redirectional
	301 -> URL redirection perm
	302 -> temp redirection
	304 -> Cache

# Important	
4XX -> Client side error
	404 -> Not found
	400 -> Bad request, invalid JSON
	401 -> Unauthorised, no authentication
	403 -> Forbidden, no permission to this

5XX -> Server side error
	500 -> Internal server error
	503 -> Service unavailable
