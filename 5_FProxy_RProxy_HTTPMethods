Common Commands used in projects:
/var/log # we can see logs location in Linux
tail-f messages # we can see running log
less messages # to check logs and shift+g we go from downonwards

telnet ipaddress portnumber # check the destination server is up

commands:
sudo su - # switch to super user or root user
dnf install nginx -y # install the nginx by providing yes
systemctl enable nginx # enable the nginx service
systemctl start nginx # start the nginx service
systemctl status nginx # check the nginx service is running or not

#Request going from webserver to backend server we use proxy

Proxy means -> on behalf of someone

we have Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy

Client and Server roles changes depending on situation or scenario basis.

Client and Server: Mobile(Client) -> Netflix(Server)
VPN: hide client identity
client request vpn -> on behalf of the client vpn request to server to provide the data

	        client    server
client -> proxy  -> server
client    server 



Forward Proxy
==============
1. hiding client identity
2. forward proxy sits in between client and server
3. client aware
4. reason to use forward proxy: VPN, content filtering, traffic monitoring, browser logging
5. Can be used as caching or cache server also means if same data was requested by multiple users then that data directly downloaded from cache server only instead of destination server or internet.
6. Forward proxy can be used as VPN
7. forward proxy is a client side proxy 

client -> forward proxy -> internet


Reverse Proxy
=============
1. Hiding server identity
2. Server Aware
3. reason to use reverse proxy is Security reasons and queue management
4. queue management or Load balancing both are same
5. It is used for SSL/TLS/HTTPS termination, if you want to increase the speed of data between frontend-backend-db server have to remove https for web applications because encryption is not required
when an request entered in frontend server encryption and decryption of a request in each server makes data access request slow it is required only before data request enter into frontend server.
6. nginix is reverse proxy

client -> reverse proxy -> server
