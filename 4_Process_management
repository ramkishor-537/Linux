Process management
==================
Delivery Manager -> he creates some task in his to-do list and assign to TL
TL -> he creates some task in his to-do list and assign to SE
Sr.Engineer -> he creates some task in his to-do list and assign to JE
Fresher -> he creates some task in his to-do list and complete the task

		             Parent -> Child
Who is parent for TL    -> DM

When system is turned on then it will start root process.
0 -> ProcessInstanceID
1 -> PID

PID		ParentPID
2		0
3		1


command: ps # process started by current user

whatever the task you give to Linux. 
first it will create one ProcessinstanceID then work on it, give the results and complete the process

command: ps -ef # display all the list of process which are started on Linux system

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 01:52 ?        00:00:01 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize=32
root           2       0  0 01:52 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
root           3       2  0 01:52 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_gp]
root           4       2  0 01:52 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_par_gp]
root           5       2  0 01:52 ?        00:00:00 [slub_flushwq]


check nginx process is running or not?
command: ps -ef | grep nginx

Now we can say that process of nginx is running and service of nginx is also running



1. background process : command: sleep 10 &
the sleep ran in background

2. foreground process -> blocks the screen, we can't do anything

3. 
a. how to kill or terminate the process?
command: kill processid or pid
b. sometimes a process may not be killed then kill the process forcibly
command: kill -9 pid  

4. command: top # show the list of process how much consuming the cpu, memory or ram





Q. what to do when a process in running but application is not working?
Ans: 
a. take backup of all the logs server logs, app logs, DB logs, heap dump,etc... then do tar for it
b. command: top  #check how much mem and cpu is consumed
c. kill the process and restart services


a person ran a PLSQL query in mysqlbench in prod server -> the time taken to execute the query is 30min.
that person executed 30 to 40 times of query
each time execution of a query a process is created -> CPU, RAM and HD consumed.
server went down and unable to take remote.
so went to data center restart the server or reboot the server in the cloud and terminated the process which caused the prod server gone down

Don't do wrong in prod server in banking domain projects.

process should be followed in project then only project will be successful otherwise not.
If you know the technology and you don't follow the process then project will not be successful.


3 tier architecture
===================
Desktop applications

Disadvantages of using desktop applications:
1. consumes more resources
2. install, upgrade, repairs
3. data is stored in local computer
4. you should install antivirus
5. what if laptop crashes?
6. can't access from remote

to overcome disadvantages of desktop application then applications are moved to web.

applications are moved to 1 tier -> 2 tier -> 3 tier

Database Server -> Application servers can access the data by running the sql/nosql query -> it handovers the data to webserver -> Webserver decorates them with HTML, CSS and JS -> Show to user
Example:
select * from user where username="siva" and password="siva123"
if found -> 1
if not found -> 0

Database server contains: db langs sql, nosqlm cache, queues, logs
application servers: backend languages java, python
web servers: front end languages html, css, js
load balancer: public and private lb
