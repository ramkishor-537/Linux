Linus File system hierarchy:

cd / : this is root folder

/bin -> essential user command binaries/softwares/commands
example: 
	which cp
	ls -l /bin/cp

cd /boot
/boot -> static files of the boot loader or OS booting process commands or files
example: 
	Linux kernel (vmlinuz-*)
	Initial RAM disk (initramfs-*)
	GRUB bootloader files

/dev -> devices files or everything in Linux treated as a file including hardware devices keyboard, mouse, disk, USB, etc.
The files in /dev are not regular files; they are special device files created and managed by the kernel
example:
	/dev/nvme0n1   → root EBS volume  
	/dev/nvme1n1   → extra EBS disk  
	/dev/null     → trash device  
	/dev/random   → random number generator
	/dev/tty	 → Terminal device (current session)
	/dev/usb	 → USB device interface (usually managed by subdirs)
	/dev/input/eventX  → Keyboard
	/dev/input/mice  → Mouse	

/etc -> extra configuration. Configurations related to system or user installed packages are here.
These files control the behavior of the system, services, and installed applications. 
example:
	 /etc/passwd
	 /etc/group
	 /etc/systemd/system
	 /etc/nginx

/home -> any user related directories are here, /home/<username>
The /home directory is where all regular users’ personal files and settings are stored. 
Each user gets a subdirectory inside /home, named after their username.
example:
	User settings Hidden "dotfiles" like .ssh, .bashrc, .profile, .config/ store per-user settings.

/lib and /lib64 -> all required libraries are here..
The /lib directory contains essential shared libraries needed by the core system binaries in /bin and /sbin. 
These libraries are similar to .dll files in Windows or .dylib in macOS.
example:
When you run a basic command like ls, the system:

Finds /bin/ls
Loads necessary libraries from /lib
Executes the binary with support from those libraries

/lib64 ->
The /lib64 directory contains 64-bit shared libraries that are essential for running 64-bit binaries, especially those located in /bin and /sbin.
On 64-bit Linux systems, libraries are separated by architecture to avoid conflicts:
Directory Purpose /lib Contains 32-bit libraries (on multilib systems) /lib64 Contains 64-bit libraries (default on 64-bit systems)
This separation helps the OS load the correct library version depending on whether a program is 32-bit or 64-bit.


/media -> removable disks like usb, DVD, etc, are mounted here automatically in desktop environments
example:
When a user named alice inserts a USB named MyUSB, the system might mount it as:
/media/alice/MyUSB/


/mnt -> used to mount extra disks in linux server are here for temp purpose
It’s primarily intended for manual or admin use.
example:
External hard drives
USB drives (manually mounted)
Network filesystems (NFS, SMB)
ISO images


/opt -> optional. when you installed a 3rd party software manually you do it here. /opt/roboshop, /opt/tomcat, /opt/jobss etc.
example:
/opt/
├── google/
│   └── chrome/
├── myapp/
│   ├── bin/
│   ├── lib/
│   └── config/

/proc -> processor information, /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo. running process info is here related to kernel
example:
/proc/cpuinfo	Info about CPU(s)

/root -> root user home directory

/run -> running process information 
example: Process id files

/sbin -> essential root user binaries/softwares/commands
example:
fsck, iptables, reboot, iptables, init, etc.

/srv -> service, data related to system like HTML directory, NFS directory, etc.
example:
/srv/ftp, /srv/www, /srv/nfs

/swap -> virutal RAM. swap usage is more means system is under stress

/sys -> kernel sub systems

/tmp -> temporary directory in Linux

/usr -> user related commands and libs are here
example:
/usr/lib Libraries - stores shared libraries required by programs 

/var -> variable files, continously growing files are here
example:
	/var/log → system & app logs


User use these commands mostly:
/bin : if we install new commands then we use /bin
/etc
/home
/opt
/tmp
/var


Hard Disk vs Network Disk
=========================
hard disk near to computer network disk, any where in the internet like google drive, MS drive, S3, etc..

OS, DB always should be in HD, HD latency is less normal files and objects are stored in network storages

at a time one HD can be mounted to only one computer.
Network storages can be attached to multiple computers


How to add extra disk to Linux server
=====================================
1. create EBS volume
2. attach to the instance, EBS volume should in the same AZ as EC2

nvme0n1 -> root disk -> OS default purpose
nvme1n1 -> new disk -> database data, imp files and configurations are stored here..

3. list the block devices, you can see newly attached disk
4. create partition from the disk
sudo parted /dev/nvme1n1 --script mklabel gpt mkpart primary 0% 100%

/var/lib/mysql -> mysql data is stored here
/data -> redis



1. how to increase the size of existing disk from 20gb to 35gb?
solution : Aws will create a new disk and transfer the data of old disk to new disk

memory usage commands
===================
df -hT -> disk information

lsblk -> to see blocks information

free -m -> RAM usage
# -m means mb information
# free -h means human readable

htop # human readable format

how to find which process in cpu is consuming memory?
cmd: top

top 10 memory process usages in Linux? or when a server is busy or not responding then which process is consuming more?
ps aux --sort -rss | head -10

how to find which files and folders is consuming memory?
du -sh *
memory occupied by files and folders

now external disk is extended its size from 20gb to 35gb but external disk is not attached automatically.
we have to attach external increased size disk(35gb) manually to existing partition /data(mount directory) to disk (20gb) manually 
command: 
	growpart nvme1n1 1 
	# nvme1n1 is disk name 
	# 1 means partition one
	
	lsblk -> to see blocks information

# mount or attaching partitioned to /data
xfs_growfs /data

df -hT /data # /data is a directory but it is mounted to disk
