I'm sharing my understanding about BASIC LINUX COMMANDS and why i'm using it?

Absolute path : 
Where ever you are in Linux any path, we can refer the destination path directly.
We have to give whole path in your present working directory.
Example:
	/c/devops/aws-88/aws-88 -> absolute path

my present working directory is /c/users/siva
my private key was existed in this path /c/devops/aws-88/aws-88
i want to connect to ec2 instance from client
Command: ssh -i /c/devops/aws-88/aws-88 username@IPADDRESS

Relative path : 
  We already into this same location /c/devops/ where private key exists.
  we have to mention the remaining path where our private key exists.
  Example:
  	aws-88/aws-88 -> relative path

my present working directory is /c/devops
my private key was existed in this path /c/devops/aws-88/aws-88
i want to connect to ec2 instance from client
Command: ssh -i /aws-88/aws-88 username@IPADDRESS


Basic Linux commands:
  1. cd -> change directory

  2. clear -> clear the screen

  3. $ -> normal user

  4. normal user will land into home directory : /home/ec2-user -> /home/<user-name>
     a normal user cannot install software's in Linux system

  5. pwd -> /home/ec2-user 

  6. sudo su -> su means super user
     if you want root access or administrator access

  7. # -> super user

  8. sudo su -
     you will land into root user home directory
     /root -> root user home directory
  
  Everything is command and text in Linux, 
  Everything you can get it through commands
  Command syntax: <inputs> <options>
  <inputs> <options> -> optional or mandatory based on the command
  
  9. 
   a. uname -> print os/kernel information
      output: Linux

   b. uname --help -> print system information

   c. uname -i -> print hardware platform
      output: x86_64

   d. uname -a -> print all information

   e. uname -o -> print the OS information

  10. man uname -> print manual information of uname command and its arguments
  
  Anything is related to CRUD operations in any field
  CRUD -> create, read, update, delete
  
  11. ls -> list subdirectories, files

  12. ls -l -> long format alphabetical order.. file/folder who owns it, size, timestamp and list detailed information

  13. ls -lr -> reverse alphabetical order

  14. ls -lt -> latest files on top or timestamp wise need alphabetical order

  15. ls -ltr -> latest files at bottom of timestamp wise in alphabetical order

  16. cd -> to home directory from wherever you are

  17. ls -ltrrhac -> h means human readable format
      a means hidden files/folders start with .
      c means sort first based on time
      r means display the sorted files based on time in last

  18. ls -a -> hidden files/folders

  19. ls -la -> long listing format to see hidden files

  20. ls -lart -> list hidden files/folders in reverse order based on timestamp first
  
  21. create file : touch devops.txt

  22. create folder : mkdir devops

  23. ls -la
      output: 
        d rwx------ : starting d means directory
        - rw-r--r-- : starting - means file

  24. enter text into file : cat > devops.txt
      Hi, I am learning devops
      press enter and ctrl+d

  25. cat devops.txt : read the content in the file

  26. change text in file : cat > devops.txt
  Hi, I am learning Linux
  
  > : redirection, usually overrides the previous text
  >> : appends new text to the end of existing text in the file
  
  27. cat >> devops.txt
      Hi, I am learning devsecops

  28. cat devops.txt
      Hi, I am learning Linux
      Hi, I am learning devsecops

  29. remove a file : rm devops.txt

  30. move one step back : cd ..

  31. remove directory : rm devops
  
  source -> which file to copy
  destination -> destination
  32. cp <source> <destination>
      Command: cp aws.txt devops

  33. mv aws.txt devops 
  cut file from source location and past or move the file in destination location

  34. mv aws.txt devops-with-aws.txt
  rename the existing file

  35. mv aws.txt devops/linux-redhat.txt
      folder/new_file_name
      mv -> rename or move the file
  
  curl or wget commands are used to downloading files or software's or packages
  36. wget urlname
  it is used download the packages
  web get means command: wget
  
  how to browse or read the text in Linux?
  curl : shows the output on the screen will not download by default
  it is used to hit the api url's
  curl is more powerful
  curl is used to perform CRUD operations on API urls
  37. curl urlname
  
  grep: command to search a word inside the file
    grep word_to_search filename
  38. grep user session02.txt
      It shows matching lines where user exists in the file
      user is a word
      session02.txt filename

  39. grep -n user session02.txt
      -n displays the line number where the user word exists
      word will display with line numbers
      output: 101: which part user
  
  40. By default Linux is case sensitive
      if you want case insensitive then use -i
      cmd: grep -n -i user session02.txt
      Output: 
        101: which part user
        104: which another User
  
  41. grep -c user session02.txt
      -c how many occurrences of user word there in file

  42. grep -v user session02.txt 
      -v means verbose or shows non matching lines

  43. grep -c user session02.txt
      shows matching line numbers count
  
  display line number ending with the word architecture
  $ -> ending word
  ^ -> starting word
  44. 
    a. grep 'architecture$' session02.txt
       display the line the word ending with $
    b. grep '^ssh' session02.txt
      display the line the word starting with ^

  45. history : whatever we ran the commands previously that shows it

  46. ctrl+r : start typing you can see the commands you used
      whatever commands given previously it will display all when we type related word
      Example: type the word and it will display accordingly
      'wg': wget url
  
  head and tail
  47. head session02.txt
      displays top 10 lines by default

  48. tail session02.txt
      displays bottom 10 lines by default

  49. head -n 3 session02.txt
      -n : specific number of lines
      display the top 3 lines

  50. tail -n 3 session02.txt
      display bottom 3 lines
  
  pipe: |
  51. I want 5 to 15 lines in a file what is the command?
      Command: head -n 15 filename | tail -n 10 filename
      first cmd output will be input to second command
  
  52. cat session02.txt | grep user
      search user word in session02.txt file

  53. how do you check running log?
      tail -f filename 
      -f means follow the running log
      come out : ctrl+c
  
  IMPORTANT COMMANDS and ADVANCED COMMANDS:
  cut and awk:
    these two commands are used for text processing
  54. print the word
      command: echo world

  55. cut command can be used for basic usage
      a. command: echo url | cut -d "/" -f1
         -d is delimiter
         -f1 means first fragment 1
      b. command: echo url | cut -d "/" -f2
         -d is delimiter
         -f2 means first fragment 2
      c. command: echo url | cut -d "/" -f3
         -d is delimiter
         -f3 means first fragment 3
  
  56. cut -d "/" -f1 <file-name>
      Example:
        echo https://www.google.com | cut -d "/" -f3
        output: www.google.com
  
  57. how do you display all users or username in Linux?
      command: cut -d ":" -f1 /etc/passwd
      -d mean delimiter
      -f means fragment or which part
  
  58. display all username and userid
      cat /etc/passwd/
      cut -d ":" f1,3 /etc/passwd/
  
  59. awk command can be used for advance purpose
      we can use if conditions etc
      echo urlname | awk -F "/" '{print $NF}'
      -F is fragment in awk cmd
      $NF means Nth fragment or last fragment
  
  60. awk -F ":" '{print $1F,$3F}' /etc/passwd
      prints username and id
      Example:
        echo https://www.google.com | awk -F "/" '{print $NF}'
        output: www.google.com
